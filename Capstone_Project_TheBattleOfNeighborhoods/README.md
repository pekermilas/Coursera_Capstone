## **Brooklyn vs Queens: A Comparison for new residents**

Having a job in New York City (NYC) and particularly in Manhattan area is
one of the greatest experiences in life and a huge step in one's 
business career as well. Yet, living in a highly populated business center 
as Manhattan is a huge struggle for many of its residents by means of quite 
high rental prices, scarcity in parking places and many other elements of the 
city. This is why two boroughs of NYC, namely Brooklyn and Queens are gaining
popularity as alternative residential areas among newcomers to NYC.[1],[3]

Both of these boroughs are known to offer relatively lower rental prices and 
efficient enough transportation to Manhattan. They are also famous for having
highly diverse multicultural environments, offering their residents spectacular 
views of the iconic skyline of NYC, and a colorful social life with dining places
and nightlife. [1],[2]

Although there are many magazine articles about the comparison of these two boroughs
of NYC, finding a quantitative comparison is very hard to find. Threfore, my project
will be a quantitative comparison of the two areas in terms of types quantities of
their nearby venues.
